            description: `View file contents or list directory structure.

USE WHEN:
- You need to read a file's current contents before editing
- You want to verify a file exists and check its current state
- You need to see directory structure and contents
- You want to inspect code, configuration files, or documentation
- You need to understand the context before making changes

DO NOT USE WHEN:
- You need to search for text across multiple files (use search instead)
- You need to find files by name pattern (use search with search_type: "files")
- You need to execute a command (use bash instead)

BEFORE CALLING: Ask yourself - do I know the exact file path? If not, use search first.

PARAMETERS:
- path: Absolute or relative file/directory path to view
- start_line (optional): First line number to display for large files (1-indexed)
- end_line (optional): Last line number to display for large files (inclusive)

RETURNS:
- File contents with line numbers (for files)
- Directory listing with file/folder names (for directories)
- Error message if path doesn't exist or can't be read

IF THIS FAILS:
- "File not found" → Check the path spelling, try viewing parent directory first
- "Permission denied" → The file may be protected, inform the user
- "Is a directory" → Add a trailing slash or use without line range parameters

BEST PRACTICES:
- Always view before editing existing files to avoid conflicts
- Use line ranges (start_line/end_line) for files over 100 lines to reduce token usage
- Combine with search tool for locating specific content in large files
- View parent directory first if unsure about file structure`,

USE WHEN:
- You need to create a completely new file that doesn't exist
- You're scaffolding new components, modules, or configuration files
- You're generating documentation, tests, or build artifacts
- You need to write initial boilerplate or templates

DO NOT USE WHEN:
- The file already exists (use str_replace_editor or edit_file instead)
- You want to modify an existing file (use str_replace_editor)
- You're not sure if the file exists (use view_file to check first!)

CRITICAL: Using create_file on an existing file will FAIL. Always verify with view_file first if uncertain.

PARAMETERS:
- path: Full file path where the new file should be created (including filename)
- content: Complete text content to write to the file

RETURNS:
- Success confirmation with the created file path
- Error if file already exists at that path
- Error if parent directory doesn't exist or write permission denied

IF THIS FAILS:
- "File already exists" → Use str_replace_editor to modify the existing file instead
- "No such directory" → Create the parent directory first with bash: mkdir -p /path/to/dir
- "Permission denied" → The directory may be protected, inform the user

BEST PRACTICES:
- Use view_file first to verify the file doesn't already exist
- Ensure parent directories exist before creating the file
- For existing files, use str_replace_editor or edit_file instead
- Include complete, valid content (avoid placeholders like "TODO" unless intentional)
- Use appropriate file extensions for the content type`,

USE WHEN:
- You need to make precise, targeted edits to existing files
- You want to change specific strings, variable names, or values
- You need to update configuration values or constants
- You're making single-line or small multi-line edits
- You want to rename identifiers across a file (with replace_all)

DO NOT USE WHEN:
- The file doesn't exist yet (use create_file instead)
- You haven't viewed the file yet (view_file first!)
- You need to create a new file from scratch (use create_file)
- Making the same change across multiple files (use batch_edit)

CRITICAL: You MUST use view_file before using this tool. Edits without viewing first often fail due to incorrect assumptions about whitespace, indentation, or exact content.

PARAMETERS:
- path: Path to the file to edit
- old_str: Exact text to find and replace (must match EXACTLY including whitespace and indentation)
- new_str: Text to replace the old string with
- replace_all (optional): If true, replaces all occurrences; if false/omitted, replaces only first occurrence

RETURNS:
- Success message with number of replacements made
- Error if old_str is not found in the file
- Error if old_str is ambiguous (appears multiple times when replace_all is false)
- File contents preview showing the changes made

IF THIS FAILS:
- "String not found" → You likely have incorrect whitespace/indentation. View the file again and copy the exact text.
- "Multiple matches found" → Make old_str more specific by including surrounding lines, OR use replace_all=true if you want to replace all.
- "File not found" → Check the path, the file may need to be created with create_file instead.

BEST PRACTICES:
- Always use view_file first to see exact content and formatting
- Copy old_str directly from the view_file output to ensure exact match
- Include enough context in old_str to make it unique when not using replace_all
- Preserve exact indentation and whitespace from the original
- Use replace_all=true for renaming variables/functions throughout a file
- For complex edits spanning many lines, consider edit_file (Morph) instead
- Verify the edit by viewing the file again after replacement`,

USE WHEN:
- You need to run system commands (ls, mkdir, rm, mv, cp, etc.)
- You want to execute build tools (npm, yarn, pip, cargo, make, etc.)
- You need to run tests, linters, or formatters
- You're working with version control (git commands)
- You need to check system information or environment variables
- You want to install dependencies or manage packages

DO NOT USE WHEN:
- You just want to read a file's contents (use view_file instead - it's faster and shows line numbers)
- You're searching for text in files (use search instead - it's optimized for this)
- You need to edit a file (use str_replace_editor or edit_file instead)

BEFORE CALLING: Consider if there's a specialized tool that does this better. bash is powerful but other tools provide better feedback.

PARAMETERS:
- command: The complete bash command to execute (single string)

RETURNS:
- Command output (stdout) showing the results
- Error output (stderr) if the command fails
- Exit code indicating success (0) or failure (non-zero)
- Combined stdout/stderr for comprehensive feedback

IF THIS FAILS:
- "Command not found" → Check spelling, the tool may not be installed
- "Permission denied" → May need different permissions, inform the user
- "No such file or directory" → Verify the path exists before the operation
- Timeout → Command took too long, try breaking it into smaller operations

BEST PRACTICES:
- Use absolute paths when possible to avoid ambiguity
- Chain commands with && for dependent operations (e.g., "cd dir && npm install")
- Check file/directory existence before operations that depend on them
- Avoid interactive commands that require user input
- Use appropriate error handling (e.g., "|| true" to ignore errors if needed)
- Be cautious with destructive operations (rm, mv, overwriting files)
- Quote paths with spaces properly (e.g., "cd 'My Documents'")`,

- You want to locate files by name or path pattern
- You're searching for function/class/variable definitions or usages
- You need to find configuration values or documentation
- You want to understand how a feature is implemented across files
- You're looking for all occurrences of a pattern to make consistent changes

DO NOT USE WHEN:
- You already know the exact file path (use view_file instead - it's faster)
- You need to execute a command or see system info (use bash)
- You need to make edits (use str_replace_editor after finding the file)

BEFORE CALLING: Think about what you're searching for. Use search_type='files' if looking for a filename, search_type='text' if looking for content inside files.

PARAMETERS:
- query: Text to search for or file name/path pattern (required)
- search_type: 'text' (search file contents), 'files' (search file names), or 'both' (default: 'both')
- include_pattern: Glob pattern for files to include (e.g., '*.ts', 'src/**/*.js')
- exclude_pattern: Glob pattern for files to exclude (e.g., '*.log', 'node_modules/**')
- case_sensitive: Whether search should be case sensitive (default: false)
- whole_word: Whether to match whole words only (default: false)
- regex: Whether query is a regex pattern (default: false)
- max_results: Maximum number of results to return (default: 50)
- file_types: Array of file extensions to search (e.g., ['js', 'ts', 'py'])
- include_hidden: Whether to include hidden files/directories (default: false)

RETURNS:
- List of matching files with line numbers and context (for text search)
- List of matching file paths (for file name search)
- Number of total matches found
- Preview of matched content with surrounding context

IF THIS FAILS OR RETURNS NO RESULTS:
- Try broader search terms (remove specific words)
- Check spelling of the query
- Try different search_type (maybe you meant 'files' instead of 'text')
- Remove file_types restriction if set
- Try case_sensitive=false if you're unsure about casing

BEST PRACTICES:
- Start with broad searches, then narrow with include/exclude patterns
- Use search_type='files' for finding files by name quickly
- Use regex=true for complex pattern matching (e.g., function signatures)
- Set whole_word=true to avoid partial matches in variable names
- Limit results with max_results to avoid overwhelming output
- Use file_types to search specific languages and avoid irrelevant matches
- Combine with view_file to inspect full context of matches`,

            description: `Create a new todo list for planning and tracking multi-step tasks.

USE WHEN:
- Starting a complex task that requires multiple steps
- User requests a plan or breakdown of work to be done
- You need to organize and track progress on a feature implementation
- Working on tasks with dependencies that should be completed in order
- You want to provide visibility into what work remains

PARAMETERS:
- todos: Array of todo item objects, each containing:
  - id: Unique identifier for the todo item (use descriptive slugs like "setup-auth")
  - content: Clear description of what needs to be done (imperative form: "Add authentication")
  - status: Current state - 'pending' (not started), 'in_progress' (actively working), or 'completed'
  - priority: Urgency level - 'high', 'medium', or 'low'

RETURNS:
- Confirmation that the todo list was created
- Visual representation of all tasks with their statuses
- Summary of pending, in-progress, and completed items

BEST PRACTICES:
- Create todo list at the start of complex multi-step tasks
- Break down large tasks into smaller, actionable items
- Use descriptive content that clearly states what needs to be done
- Set only one item to 'in_progress' at a time to show current focus
- Order todos by dependency (things that must be done first, earlier in list)
- Use priority to highlight critical items
- Update the list with update_todo_list as you make progress`,

- updates: Array of update objects, each containing:
  - id: The unique identifier of the todo item to update (required)
  - status: New status - 'pending', 'in_progress', or 'completed' (optional)
  - content: New description text for the todo (optional)
  - priority: New priority level - 'high', 'medium', or 'low' (optional)

RETURNS:
- Confirmation of updates applied
- Updated visual representation of the todo list
- Summary showing which items were modified

BEST PRACTICES:
- Mark tasks as 'in_progress' when you start working on them
- Mark tasks as 'completed' immediately after finishing
- Only have one task as 'in_progress' at a time for clarity
- Update status frequently to keep the list current and accurate
- Use content updates to refine tasks as you learn more details

USE WHEN:
- You need to make multiple related edits to a single file
- You're refactoring code with changes in several locations
- You want to add, modify, or remove functions/classes/blocks
- You're making complex edits that span many lines
- You need to edit large files without rewriting the entire content

PARAMETERS:
- target_file: Path to the file you want to modify
- instructions: Single sentence describing your intent in first person (e.g., "I am adding error handling to the API calls")
- code_edit: The edited code showing ONLY the changes, using "// ... existing code ..." to represent unchanged sections

RETURNS:
- Success confirmation with applied changes
- Diff preview showing what was modified
- Error if the edit cannot be applied due to ambiguity or conflicts

BEST PRACTICES:
- View the file first to understand its current structure
- Write clear, specific instructions that explain the "why" of your edit
- Show multiple edits in sequence with "// ... existing code ..." between them
- Include 2-3 lines of unchanged context around each edit for clarity
- NEVER omit code without "// ... existing code ..." or it may be deleted
- For deletions, show context before and after the deleted section
- Batch all changes to a file in ONE edit_file call (don't make multiple calls)
- Use language-appropriate comment syntax (// for JS/TS, # for Python, etc.)
- Minimize repeated code - only show what changes and surrounding context

EXAMPLE PATTERN:
// ... existing code ...
function oldFunction() {
  // new implementation
  return newValue;
}
// ... existing code ...
const newConstant = 42;
